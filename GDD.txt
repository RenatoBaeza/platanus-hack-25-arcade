Title: "TurboTurbo"

1. High Concept
A 2D side-scroller, battle-racing arcade game for 2 players, where the screen constantly scrolls to the right.
Players use quick reflexes and item attacks to survive hazards and outlast or outpace their rival.
You don’t race by moving forward — the world scrolls. The goal: stay alive and stay ahead.

2. Core Gameplay Loop
- Players spawn on screen with N lives each which is shown in the UI.
- The world begins scrolling right — terrain, walls, and obstacles come toward them.
- Players must evade obstacles and collect item boxes.
- Item boxes give weapons or life bonuses.
- Use weapons to eliminate the opponent or push them into hazards.
- After 60 seconds (shown in the UI), the race ends — the player farthest to the right wins.

3. Objective
- Primary Win Condition: Be alive when your opponent dies.
- Secondary Win Condition: When the 60s timer runs out, be further to the right (ahead).

4. Controls (Arcade-Style)
Player 1 uses WASD and E for activating an item
Player 2 uses the arrow keys and Enter for activating an item

5. Player Mechanics
- Lives: N starting lives.
- Can gain extra lives through item boxes that randomly spawn as the terrain moves in front of players. Hitting your car to a life box immediately applies one life.
- Can obtain weapons by hitting a weapon box, which can be used with the action button. Only one weapon can be stored at a time.
- Position: The player’s character stays roughly centered horizontally; only slight forward/backward offset allowed for head-to-head pushing.
- Death: Losing all lives removes you from the match.

6. Item boxes
Randomly spawn along the track; player touches to open. Each box looks different.
Possible rewards:
- Extra Life: +1 life, instant effect
- Front Missile: Shoots forward; explodes on hit with the rival player, with a wall or if out of screen
- Back Missile: Shoots behind; explodes on hit with the rival player, with a wall or if out of screen
- Sides Missile: Shoots to both sides of the player; explodes on hit with the rival player, with a wall or if out of screen

7. Environment & Obstacles
Scrolling Terrain: Background moves continuously to the right at increasing speed.

Obstacles:
- Destructible walls (breakable with missiles)
- Indestructible terrain (must dodge)
- Spikes or electric traps (deal 1 life damage on touch)

Scrolling Speed Curve:
- 0–20s: Slow (intro pace)
- 20–40s: Medium (more hazards)
- 40–60s: Fast (chaotic, high tension)

8. Visual Style
Camera: Fixed side-scrolling with parallax background layers (skyline, terrain, obstacles).

UI Elements:
- Timer countdown (60s)
- Player 1 & 2 life indicators (hearts)
- Current item icon for each Player

9. Audio
- Music: Energetic synthwave or chiptune loop.
- SFX: Missile launch/explosion, Item pickup, Damage / death, Countdown buzzer at 10s remaining

End of Match:
- Winner shown (“Player 1 Wins!” or “Player 2 Wins!”)
- Option to rematch or return to title screen
